		<p "style=color:white;"> Though the Centre has cut the excise duty on petrol and diesel thus bringing down<br>
		the retail prices of the fuels, states, except a few, have not yet followed the suit.<br>
		This has also left state taxes higher than the central levies on fuels.<br>
		Hereâ€™s the full break-up of taxes one pays on petrol and diesel:
		Following the excise duty cut, the price of petrol in Delhi <br>
		on Tuesday stood at Rs 96.72 a litre as against Rs 105.41 a litre earlier,<br>
		while diesel cost Rs 89.62 a litre as opposed to Rs 96.67 earlier.<br>
		All states across the country have witnessed the price fall after the duty cut by the Centre.<br>
		Over and above this, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Kerala have also cut value-added taxes,<br>
		thus bringing down the fuel prices even further.</P>
